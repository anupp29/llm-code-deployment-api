# 🚀 Deployment Status

## ✅ **Vercel Deployment - SUCCESSFUL**

Your LLM Code Deployment API has been successfully deployed to Vercel!

**🌐 Live URL**: `https://tds-project-1-main-ii7dlyssf-driveourdestiny-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app`

### **⚠️ Important Vercel Limitations**

While your app is deployed, **Vercel has significant limitations** for this type of application:

1. **⏱️ Timeout Limits**: 10-60 seconds max (your GitHub operations may timeout)
2. **🔄 No Background Tasks**: Processes requests synchronously only
3. **💾 No Persistent Storage**: No database between requests
4. **🔒 Cold Starts**: May be slow for first requests

### **🎯 Recommended: Deploy to Railway Instead**

Railway is **much better suited** for your application because it supports:
- ✅ Long-running processes
- ✅ Background tasks
- ✅ Persistent storage
- ✅ No timeout limits
- ✅ Better GitHub API integration

## 🚂 **Deploy to Railway (Recommended)**

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up

# Set environment variables
railway variables set USER_SECRET="TDS DEDLY"
railway variables set GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"
railway variables set GITHUB_USERNAME="your_username"
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
railway variables set OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://aipipe.org/openai/v1"
```

## 🧪 **Test Your Deployed API**

### **Vercel (Current)**
```bash
curl -X POST https://tds-project-1-main-ii7dlyssf-driveourdestiny-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/api-endpoint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "23f2003212@ds.study.iitm.ac.in",
    "secret": "TDS DEDLY",
    "task": "demo-task",
    "round": 1,
    "nonce": "unique-id",
    "brief": "Create a simple web page",
    "checks": ["Page loads"],
    "evaluation_url": "https://httpbin.org/post"
  }'
```

### **Health Check**
```bash
curl https://tds-project-1-main-ii7dlyssf-driveourdestiny-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app/health
```

## 📊 **Next Steps**

1. **✅ Set Environment Variables** in Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add all required variables

2. **🧪 Test the API** with the curl commands above

3. **🚂 Consider Railway** for production use due to better compatibility

4. **📈 Monitor Performance** and watch for timeout issues

## 🎉 **Success!**

Your LLM Code Deployment API is now live and accessible worldwide! 

**Vercel URL**: https://tds-project-1-main-ii7dlyssf-driveourdestiny-gmailcoms-projects.vercel.app
